   - Bot permissions: `Administrator` (or select specific permissions)
   - Copy and visit the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

3. **Get a TMDB API Key**:
   - Create an account on [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org)
   - Go to your account settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Request a new API key
   - Fill out the form and get your API key

4. **Configure the Bot**:
   - Set up the `config.json` file (see Configuration section below)
   - Run the bot: `node bot-start.js`
   - Alternatively, run `node deploy-commands.js` to register slash commands
   - Use the `/configure` command in Discord to set up the bot

5. **Use the Bot**:
   - The bot will automatically announce new movies
   - Use `/status` to check if everything is working
   - Use `/movie [title]` to search for movies
   - Use `/announce` to manually trigger announcements
   - Use `/refresh feed` to force refresh movie data (Moderator only)
   - Use `/refresh frequency 15` to change check interval to 15 minutes (Moderator only)

## In-Discord Setup with `/configure`

The easiest way to set up the bot is to use the `/configure` command in Discord:

1. Run the command `/configure`
2. Use the options to set:
   - `channel` - The announcement channel
   - `role` - The role to mention for announcements
   - `interval` - How often to check for new movies (in minutes)
   - `auto_announce` - Enable or disable automatic announcements

Only users with Administrator permissions can use this command.

## Configuration File

The bot can also be configured using the `config.json` file:

```
{
  "token": "DISCORD_TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER",
  "clientId": "YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID",
  "guildId": "YOUR_SERVER_ID",
  "tmdbApiKey": "TMDB_API_KEY_PLACEHOLDER",
  "roleId": "ROLE_ID_TO_MENTION",
  "announcementChannelId": "CHANNEL_ID_FOR_ANNOUNCEMENTS",
  "announcementChannelName": "announcements",
  "checkInterval": 10,
  "embedColor": "#0099ff",
  "autoAnnounce": true
}
```

You should replace the placeholder values with your actual Discord token and TMDB API key, or set the environment variables:
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` for your Discord bot token
- `TMDB_API_KEY` for your TMDB API key

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot doesn't respond**: Check that you've enabled the correct intents
- **Can't find role/channel**: Use the `/status` command to see what the bot detects
- **No announcements**: Make sure `autoAnnounce` is set to `true` and `checkInterval` is reasonable

## Deployment

For continuous operation, it's recommended to deploy the bot on a server or hosting platform.
